### My Assessment Repository

Welcome to my assessment repository! This has been created as part of the Web Services and Applications module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU.

About This Repository
This space holds the work I’ve completed for the module, including assessment tasks and my final project. It reflects the skills and knowledge I’ve developed over the course of the semester—from working with data and building web-based applications to applying analytical techniques in real-world scenarios.

I’ve written this README with GitHub’s guidelines on writing READMEs in mind. If you're new to Markdown or want to learn more, GitHub also offers great documentation on Markdown.
